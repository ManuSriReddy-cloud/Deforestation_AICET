#Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data (2021–2023)
*India witnesses various types of fire incidents annually, including forest fires, agricultural burning, volcanic activity, and other thermal anomalies. Accurate *identification of fire sources is crucial for timely disaster response, environmental monitoring, and resource management. The MODIS sensors aboard NASA’s Terra *and Aqua satellites provide reliable, near real-time thermal anomaly data globally, including for India.

*While the MODIS dataset includes rich geospatial and thermal parameters, the challenge lies in correctly classifying the type of fire event — whether it stems *from vegetation, volcanoes, static land sources, or offshore sources — using satellite-captured features.

#Objective:
*To develop a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict the type of fire using MODIS fire detection data for India from 2021 to 2023

# MODIS Dataset Summary (India: 2021–2023)
# About MODIS:
*The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a key NASA sensor aboard the Terra (launched 1999) and Aqua (launched 2002) satellites. It captures *Earth observation data at a spatial resolution of 1 km, suitable for global fire monitoring and environmental studies.

*MODIS data used in this project is sourced from NASA’s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) and focuses on thermal anomalies and active fire *detection.
#Satellite Characteristics:
*Terra satellite (EOS AM) captures morning overpasses.

*Aqua satellite (EOS PM) captures afternoon overpasses.

*MODIS provides 2–4 observations per day, especially in mid-latitudes like India.

# Fire Detection Mechanism:
*MODIS uses contextual algorithms to detect thermal anomalies.

*It evaluates each pixel using mid-infrared channels (Bands 21/22 for fire detection and 31 for surface temperature).

*The pixel is marked as one of: missing, cloud, water, non-fire, fire, or unknown.

# Note on Accuracy:
*MODIS NRT (Near Real-Time) data may have slightly lower geolocation accuracy, particularly from Aqua satellite due to orbit estimation delays. Errors can *occasionally reach several kilometers

#Use Cases for MODIS Fire Data:
*Real-time wildfire alerts

*Agricultural burn detection

*Forest fire management

*Hotspot pattern analysis in ecological studies
